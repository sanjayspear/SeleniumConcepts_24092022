   Note: Let suppose your script is running in a remote machine and every time we can't go and login to remote machine to check program 
         status. Instead we can use logs. Logs are very much useful in terms of debugging codes. To check any exceptions, null pointer
         exception or any kind of exceptions are occurring and what is the route cause / file is missing / jar is missing easily we track
         it from log.
